park SQL allows relational queries expressed in SQL to be executed using Spark. This enables to apply queries to Spark data structures and also to Spark data streams (see below).

As SQL queries generate Spark data structures, a mixture of SQL and native Spark operations is also possible, thus providing a sophisticated mechanism to compute valuable insight from data in real-time.

The code example below illustrates how to apply SQL queries on a Spark data structure (RDD) and provide further insight by mixing with native Spark operations.
